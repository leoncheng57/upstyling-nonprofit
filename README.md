## Purpose

Central website for the nonprofit Upstyling, started by two high schoolers in Georgia. Upstyling takes donated artwork/creations from the youth across the country and sell them for a profit that goes directly to charities surrounding the major issues in our world.

## My Motivation

I wanted to challenge myself to build an entire website from the research & design phase all the way to code and deployment. I was able to do that by working on a little by little over the span of a month. I especially enjoyed communicating with the cofounder to build them something that would help a positive impact, figuring out how to make a design that fit their theme, and seeing the completed project on the world wide web.

- Pug
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- Adobe XD and Illustrator
